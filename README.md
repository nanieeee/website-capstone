A website called "Capstone
Website Project." This project involved building a responsive
website with five key pages, using Nuxt.js as your framework and TailwindCSS for styling.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c74544ce-4fcd-432d-b89f-0b735d3eaee6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/faranie-website-capstone5af480/deploys)

The first page should be the homepage which displays the hero banner.
### HomePage (HeroBanner) ###
- The HeroBanner section should contain:
  - The main header and subheader
  - a submission button (PrimaryButton component)   
  - A heading tag containing the company name ("EarthSaver")
The second page should be the About page.
-   The About page should include an image from the EarthSaver brand in the background.
-   Over this image there will be a brief description of what EarthSaver does. 
The third page should be the Sustainability page.
-   This page should display three columns each holding one section about how EarthSaver achieves sustainability
The fourth page is the Blog page that lists articles in a list form. 
- You need to create at least 3 blog posts on this site.
- Each post should have a title, published date, and a brief description.
The fifth page is the Contact page consisting of an input form and a submission button. 
A sixth page could be optional but if included it would display any projects the company has completed in the past.
